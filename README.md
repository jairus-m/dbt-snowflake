### Learning dbt project

I am currently in the process of learning dbt so that I can implement it as the main tool for transforming raw data in BigQuery. The goal is to be able to use this project to learn about:
- building data models
- learning about DAGs/lineage
- version control for data transformations
- testing the data
- using jinja templating for macros
- working in a dbt project folder
- debugging in the CLI, creating documentation

...and overall, maximing the features of dbt for sustainable/maintainable/scalable data transformations.

After building out this example project, I will directly use dbt in BigQuery to transform my raw activity data from my [Strava ELT pipeline](https://github.com/jairus-m/StravaETLPipeline).
